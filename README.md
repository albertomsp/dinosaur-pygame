You are a dinosaur, and you have to dodge the meteors by moving the mouse. If a meteor hits you, you lose a life. Hopefully, you can always eat a ham to recover some lives.

I made this game to learn how to use `pygame` in my 2nd year of my studies. I recently updated it to support Python 3, and to polish a bit the project (mainly translating the comments and code into English).

I also left the original one in `first_version` folder just for the old times

I recently uploaded the application to https://pypi.org/ to learn how to publish Python packages.

## Installation

This app is uploaded in https://pypi.org/. To install and run it, you just need to (you may want to run it on a virtualenv):

```text
pip install dinosaur-pygame
dinosaur_pygame  # The game is installed as a script, just needs to run that command for the game to start.
```

## Local Development

You may need to [install some prerequisites](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) to make `pygame` work. Once they are installed, to install the project:

```
make install
# `make clean` can be run to reset the project to a clean state
```

#### To run the application:

```
make run
```

#### To install the package and check if it works before publishing the new version into https://pypi.org/:

```
make install_package  # This will run the game as a console script after the package has been built.
dinosaur_pygame  # manually checks if it runs properly in the console. Run this with your venv activated.
```

Good starting documentation for pypi packages: https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/ and https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line-scripts.html#the-console-scripts-entry-point.

#### To publish the new package in test pypi

This will upload the package to test pypi. This is a good way of testing if the package will work before publishing it into the real pypi.

```
make upload_package_to_test_pypi  # it requires the test token
python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps dinosaur-pygame=={VERSION}
dinosaur_pygame  # Run the app
```

#### To publish the new package in pypi

Once every change have been thoroughly tested, we can upload the new version into the real https://pypi.org/.

A new version will be needed (`setup.py`), as existing versions in `pypi` cannot be modified.

```
make upload_package_to_pypi  # it requires the token
pip install dinosaur-pygame  # a version can be specified by dinosaur-pygame=={VERSION}
dinosaur_pygame  # runs the app
```
